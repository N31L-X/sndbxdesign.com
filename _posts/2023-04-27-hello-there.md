This is my first post to my new blog. I'm using Jekyll with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. I'm hosting it on GitHub Pages and using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for DNS and SSL. Now that I have the basics set up, I can start writing some posts. I'm looking forward to it! Until next time, have a great day!
